<pre>
This is a RESTful API for managing blog posts. It is built using Java 8 and MySQL database.

The API provides the following functionality:
* Create a new blog post
* Retrieve a list of all blog posts sorted by date and time created (newest first)
* Retrieve a single blog post by its ID
* Update an existing blog post
* Delete a blog post

The project uses Spring Boot framework and Hibernate for data persistence. It also handles exceptions gracefully.
